# A_Simple_Android_Game
Just a simple game


This android application is just a simple game that involves moving the character to the other side of the screen without touching enemy characters.

I have to say there are a few minor bugs and that this application is really quite basic, but this project was simply done with the purpose of familiarising myself with the java language and the use of Android Studio. 

I would be starting my second year of studies at NTU(Computer Science) and would be learning about OOP using Java and Softeare engineering in my first semeseter. Hence, I chose to start this project to give myself a headstart and to study the Java langauge(both syntax wise and how to code in an OOP fashion). 

This game was based on one of my favourite anime Konosuba, Note: If it isnt clear enough from the quality of the game, I do not own any image rights and do not intend to profit in anyway from it. I simply chose Konosuba to realise my application as it made my time spent making this application a lot more fun. 

I have to say i had a lot of fun making this application. Unfortunately, as of now i am quite limited in my ability to create the application as how I envisioned it to be in my mind due to a lack of knowleedge and concepts.

However, I would definitely be looking into making a much more refined and detailed application in the future! That is after I have mastered the concepts that i'll be covering in my upcoming semester. I'm sure i'll be able to make a much better application then!
